## Assignment: Setting Up an Express Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) With MongoDB

**Introduction:**

Modern web development thrives on clear separation between business logic and data access concerns. This separation promotes code reusability, reduces complexity, and enhances testability. One approach to achieve this is by implementing a Data Abstraction Layer (DAL).

This assignment delves into creating a fundamental DAL using Express.js and MongoDB. You'll build an API endpoint that interacts with a MongoDB database leveraging the `MongoClient` library. The DAL will handle tasks like inserting new data, potentially including retrieval or deletion functionalities (depending on specific requirements).

**Learning Objectives:**

- Grasp the concept and benefits of Data Abstraction Layers (DALs).
- Gain practical experience with Express.js for building APIs.
- Explore interaction with MongoDB from a Node.js application using `MongoClient`.
