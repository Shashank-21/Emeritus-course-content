### Task Introduction

This task is based on TailwindCSS. You will style the webpage containing the Top 5 Restaurants in New York City. Your task is to use Tailwind CSS to style each restaurant's information as an attractive card. This exercise will enhance your understanding of how to use Tailwind CSS for effective layout and styling.

### Task Instructions

#### Overview:

You are provided with a starter HTML file containing basic information about five NYC restaurants. Your goal is to style this information using Tailwind CSS to create visually appealing restaurant cards.

#### Starter Code:

The starter code includes the basic structure of the webpage with placeholders for each restaurant's information.

#### Requirements:

1. **Apply Tailwind CSS Classes**: For each restaurant div (`id="restaurant1"`, `id="restaurant2"`, etc.), apply Tailwind CSS classes to style the card. Each card should include:
   - A white background.
   - Rounded corners.
   - A shadow effect.
   - Padding around the content.
   - Full width within its parent container.
2. **Style Images and Text**: Use Tailwind CSS to style the images (`img` tags) and text (`h2` and `p` tags) within each card.

   - Images should have a fixed height and cover the width of the card.
   - The restaurant name (inside `h2`) should be bold and appropriately sized.
   - The locality information (inside `p`) should have a subtle text color.

3. **Consistent Layout**: Ensure the layout looks clean and organized, with all cards having a uniform style.
