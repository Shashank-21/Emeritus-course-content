In this assignment, you will create a navigation bar for a restaurant website using HTML and CSS (Bootstrap 5). The goal is to build a dynamic webpage that updates its content based on user interaction with the navigation bar.
The navigation bar should include links to different sections of the site: Home, About, and Menu.

### Instructions for Assignment:

In the `index.html` file, ensure the following components with their respective classes and IDs are correctly implemented:

1. **Navbar**: The `nav` element should have the classes: `navbar`, `navbar-expand-lg`, `navbar-light`, `bg-light`.
2. **Container Fluid**: Inside the navbar, there should be a `div` with the class `container-fluid`.
3. **Navbar Brand**: A link (`a` tag) with the class `navbar-brand` and ID `homeLink`. Inside the `a` tag, write the restaurant's name.
4. **Navbar Navigation Links**: Two links (`a` tags) with the class `nav-link`. One should have the ID `aboutLink` and the other `menuLink`. In the `a` link with the id `aboutLink`, put in the text `'About'` and in the `a` link with the id `menuLink`, put in the text `'Menu'`.
