### Building a React Shopping Cart Application

#### Introduction

In this assignment, you will develop a comprehensive Shopping Cart application using React. This project is designed to test and expand your understanding of React's core principles, including component-based architecture, state management, conditional rendering, and event handling. By creating an interactive and dynamic shopping cart, you will apply these concepts in a practical, real-world scenario that mirrors challenges faced in modern web development.

#### Objective

Your goal is to construct a fully functional shopping cart application that allows users to add items to their cart, adjust item quantities, remove items, and view a total price calculation. This application will consist of several components, including an item list for adding products, individual cart items with the ability to modify quantities, and a cart total that updates based on the items in the cart.

#### Key Features and Tasks

The application will feature the following key components and functionalities, broken down into specific tasks:

1. **Add Item to Cart:**

   - Implement functionality to add products to the shopping cart. Products should include at least a name, price, and quantity. If a user adds an existing item, its quantity should increase instead of adding a duplicate entry.

2. **Update Item Count:**

   - Enable users to update the quantity of individual items in their cart. This includes both increasing and decreasing item counts, with updates reflecting immediately in the application's UI.

3. **Remove Item from Cart:**

   - Provide users with the option to remove items from their cart entirely. This action should remove the item from the cart's state and update the displayed list of cart items accordingly.

4. **Calculate Total Price:**
   - Calculate and display the total price of all items in the cart. This total should account for each item's price and quantity, updating in real-time as items are added, removed, or adjusted.
