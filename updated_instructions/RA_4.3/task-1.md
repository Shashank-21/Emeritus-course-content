Within the `displayWelcomeMessage` function, you will find two variables: `paragraph1Content` and `paragraph2Content`.

1. Your task is to fill these variables with content for the two paragraphs. Craft a welcome message that introduces users to the personal finance manager and encourages them to explore its features.
   Example:

```js
const paragraph1Content = "Welcome to Finance Manager!";
// Similarly, fill up paragraph2Content with another message (string).
```

2. Call the `displayWelcomeMessage` function in the line specified to ensure that the welcome message displays when the page has loaded.
