1. Inside the `managePartyZones` function, you'll find a variable named `lunchCoupon`. Construct a message that includes the guest's name and the dining area, and then assign this message to `lunchCoupon`.
2. Still within the `managePartyZones` function, there's a variable named `dancePass`. For guests who are willing to dance, create a message that includes their name and the dance floor area, and assign it to `dancePass`. This needs to be done inside the `switch(willDance)` block, right below the `case true:` statement.
3. After the loop in the `managePartyZones` function, try logging the `lunchCoupon` and `dancePass` variables to the console. Observe what happens, and consider why it happens.

Once you're done, run `npm run task-03` in the terminal to see the output of your code.
