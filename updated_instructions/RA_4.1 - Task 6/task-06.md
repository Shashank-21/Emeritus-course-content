Using logical operators, set `specialDinnerCombo` to "Steak and Fries" if itâ€™s a Friday evening and to "None" on other days.
To check if it's friday, use the `currentDay` variable. It must be equal to `5`.
To check if it's evening, use the `currentHour` variable. It must be greater than or equal to `18.`

Remember that for the time to represent friday evening, _both_ the conditions must evaluate to `true`. Use the right logical operator.
