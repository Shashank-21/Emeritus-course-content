In the `greetUser` function, the name entered in the input is retreived in the `name` variable. Your task is to ensure the following:

- If the user enters a name, display a greeting in an `h1` element in the format: `"Hello, [name]!"`. For example, if the name entered is `Steve`, then the `h1` element should display `Hello, Steve!`
- If no name is entered, prompt the user with a message in a `p` element: `"Please enter your name"`.
