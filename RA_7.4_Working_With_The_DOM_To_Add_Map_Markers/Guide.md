`mapbox` is an open-source platform that allows you to create and display maps on a web page. The `mapboxgl` JavaScript library is part of the Mapbox ecosystem. It allows you to add all sorts of customizations to the map. For example, you can add a marker at a specific location on the map.

**Your task in this activity is to add a marker to the map.**

You can add your code to the `createMapMarker()` function in the `mapmarker.js` file. The marker should be set at the location defined by the following coordinates:
`Longitude: -71.091542`
`Latitude: 42.358862`

### Task Instructions:

To accomplish this task, you will need to do the following:

- Create a mapbox account and get the access token.
- Add the access token to the `mapboxgl` instance defined in the `mapmarker.js`.
- Create a marker then add it to the map using `mapboxgl` pre-built functions.
  -If your code works, you should be able to see a marker on the map.

Hint: You can learn more about how to setup the mapbox access token by reading [this documentation][https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-tokens-api/]
