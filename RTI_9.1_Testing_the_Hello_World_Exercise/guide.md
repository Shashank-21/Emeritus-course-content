Welcome to your Jest testing assignment. This exercise will sharpen your skills in writing test cases using Jest, the JavaScript Testing Framework youâ€™ve been learning so far.

While we do have a string utility file with some basic operations, the real challenge lies in the test code. Your task will be to write comprehensive test cases for the provided string functions, ensuring they work as expected. It's less about the string manipulation itself and more about validating that our code is robust and error-free.

So, prepare to put your testing hat on, think like a user, and let's ensure our code quality is top-notch. Let's get started with writing those test cases!
