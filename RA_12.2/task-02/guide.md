### Task Instructions

You are given a starter code for a `FruitContainer` component in React that manages the counts of different fruits. Your task is to implement the functionality to calculate and display the total count of all the fruits. Follow the steps below to complete the component:

1. **Calculate Total Count**:

   - Implement the logic to calculate the total count of all fruits. Use the `Object.values` method along with the `reduce` function to sum up all the counts.

2. **Display Total Count**:

   - Ensure that the total count is displayed in the `total-fruits` div correctly.

3. **Ensure State Updates**:
   - When the count for an individual fruit is updated using the `Counter` component, the total count displayed should update accordingly.
