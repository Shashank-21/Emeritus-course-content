#### Rendering Object Properties With React Hooks

Welcome to your next assignment, where you will dive into the dynamic world of React and harness the power of React Hooks. Your journey will take you through the practical application of the `useState` hook, enabling you to manage state within functional components effectively.

In this assignment, titled "Rendering Object Properties With React Hooks," you will build a vibrant fruit counter application. This application will not only help you understand the intricacies of state management but also give you hands-on experience with updating complex state objects and rendering their properties in real time.

#### Background

As React has evolved, functional components have become increasingly popular due to their simplicity and the introduction of Hooks, which allow for state and other React features without writing a class. The `useState` hook is a cornerstone of functional component state management, and it's essential to understand how to work with it when managing the state of an object, especially when the state is more complex, like in the case of nested objects or arrays.

#### The Task

You'll be creating a `FruitContainer` component that houses individual `Counter` componentsâ€”one for each fruit. Each `Counter` will keep track of how many times it has been incremented or decremented, representing the count of that particular fruit. The main goal is to render and manage the counts of several fruits, as well as to calculate and display the total count of all fruits combined.

The `Counter` component will allow users to increment, decrement, and reset the count for each fruit. The `FruitContainer` component will then display the total count by summing up the counts from all individual `Counter` components.

#### Your Learning Outcome

By the end of this assignment, you will:

- Gain proficiency in using the `useState` hook to manage state within functional components.
- Understand how to render and update object properties based on user interaction.
- Learn how to lift state up to a parent component and pass down state-modifying functions as props.
- Develop an intuition for when and how to split component logic and responsibilities.

This assignment will challenge you to think about component structure, state management, and the React rendering process. Prepare to sharpen your React skills and get a step closer to mastering functional components and hooks.

Good luck, and let's start coding!
