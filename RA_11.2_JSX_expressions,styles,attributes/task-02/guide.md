### Task: Add Inline Styling in the WelcomeCard Component

#### File to Edit

`WelcomeCard.js`

#### Task Description

Your goal is to apply inline styling to a paragraph (`<p>` tag) within the `WelcomeCard` component. You will focus on changing the background color of this paragraph.

#### Instructions

1. Inside the `WelcomeCard` component, you will find a `<p>` tag with some text.
2. Your task is to add an inline style to this `<p>` tag. Set the background color of this paragraph to `yellow`.
3. Use the `style` attribute in the `<p>` tag. Remember that in JSX, inline styles are provided as an object with camelCase property names.
4. Ensure that the background color of the paragraph is visually distinct when rendered.

#### Expected Outcome

- After you add the inline style, the paragraph should have a background color as per your implementation.
- The text within the paragraph should remain clearly visible against the background.

#### Tips

- Inline styles in JSX are different from regular HTML. They must be written as objects.
- Check your component in the browser to ensure that your style changes are visible and as expected.
- Remember to follow the React styling conventions when adding your inline styles.
