### Task Instructions: Binding the Input Field to State in the Withdraw Component

Your task is to update the input field for the withdrawal amount so that it's reactively linked to the component's state. This will allow the field to display the current value of the state and update the state as the user types in the field.

1. **Link the State to the Input Field**: Modify the input element responsible for accepting the withdrawal amount. You need to ensure that the value displayed in this input is always in sync with the corresponding state in the component.

2. **Ensure Reactivity**: The input should not only display the state's current value but also update this value as the user types in the field. Confirm that the component's state is updated with every change in the input, reflecting the user's input in real time.
