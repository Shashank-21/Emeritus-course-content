### Destructuring and Props

In this assignment, you will dive deep into two powerful features of modern JavaScript and React: destructuring and props. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable React code. By the end of this assignment, you will have hands-on experience with these concepts, applying them to build and test React components effectively.

#### Background

**Props** are the shorthand for "properties" in React. They are read-only components that must be kept pure. Props provide a way to pass data from parent to child components, making them a crucial part of React's component-based architecture. They are essential for component reusability and composition.

**Destructuring** is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. In the context of React, destructuring props simplifies the code and enhances readability, making it easier to work with component data.

#### Objectives

- **Understand Props**: Learn how to pass data to components using props and how to access this data within the components.
- **Master Destructuring**: Practice using JavaScript destructuring to extract props in a more readable and concise way.
- **Implement Components**: Apply props and destructuring to create React components that are dynamic and reusable.
- **Write Tests**: Develop tests for your components to ensure they render the props correctly, reinforcing best practices for robust React application development.

#### Tasks Overview

1. **Props in React**: You will start by creating a basic `EventCard` component that displays event details. You'll learn how to pass and access props in both functional and class components.

2. **Destructuring Props**: Refactor the `EventCard` component to use destructuring, making the code cleaner and more readable. This task will help you understand the benefits of destructuring and how it can be applied to React props.
