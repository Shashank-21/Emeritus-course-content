Simulate projectile motion by determining these two parameters:

**Velocity**
Velocity is a quantity that determines how fast an object moves and in which direction. This exercise considers two directions: x (horizontal) and y (vertical). We factored velocity into the movement of balls in task 2.

**Gravity:**
Gravity is a fundamental force that attracts an object to the surface of the Earth. For all practical purposes, we'll be assuming that gravity acts downwards.
Gravity impacts the velocity of the object over time. It increases the downward velocity of the object in every passing instance. To simulate that, we'll add the value of gravity to the value of velocity every time we update the ball's position.
