### Overview:

In this assignment, you will dive into graphics animation using JavaScript. Building upon the concepts you've learned in the previous assignments, you'll explore two intriguing simulations: random walk and projectile motion. These simulations will allow you to practice your JavaScript skills while gaining a deeper understanding of how objects move in a two-dimensional space.



**Random Movement Simulation:**
In the random movement simulation, particles take steps with a specified step size in random directions. You'll experiment with parameters to understand how step size affects particle movement, simulating phenomena like molecular diffusion.
