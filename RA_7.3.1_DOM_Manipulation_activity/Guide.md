#### Introduction

Welcome to the DOM Manipulation Assignment! In this task, you will practice essential web development skills by creating an interactive webpage. Your goal is to use JavaScript to dynamically update the webpage based on user input.

#### Objective

Create a JavaScript function that responds to a button click by displaying a personalized greeting. The function should handle cases where the user does not enter a name and prompt them accordingly.

#### Task Details

In the `greetUser` function, the name entered in the input is retreived in the `name` variable. Your task is to ensure the following:

- If the user enters a name, display a greeting in an `h1` element: `"Hello, [name]!"`.
- If no name is entered, prompt the user with a message in a `p` element: `"Please enter your name"`.

Refresh the webpage and enter the name to test your code
