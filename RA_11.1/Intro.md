### Assignment Introduction: Add A React Template To Your Project

#### Overview

Welcome to a concise yet impactful journey into React development. This assignment is crafted to introduce you to the integration of React components within any project framework. The task focuses on embedding a React template to dynamically update content based on user interactionâ€”a fundamental aspect of React's capabilities.

#### Objective

Your primary goal is to integrate a simple React "Like" Button into your existing project. This button, upon being clicked, should change its displayed text to 'You liked this.', showcasing the reactive nature of components and state management in React.

#### Task Details

1. **Implement a React "Like" Button Component:**

   - Create a React component named `LikeButton`.
   - Initially, the button should display the text "Like".
   - Upon clicking the button, the text should change to 'You liked this.', indicating that the state within the component has been updated.

2. **Embed the Component in Your Project:**
   - Place the React component within your existing project structure.
   - Ensure that the button is functional and that its state changes are reflected in the UI as expected.

#### Learning Objectives

- Understand how to create and use React components within existing projects.
- Learn the basics of state management in React and how user interactions can trigger UI updates.
- Gain experience in integrating React's reactive features to enhance user interaction in traditional web applications.

This assignment will not only familiarize you with the process of adding React components to any project but also provide a foundational understanding of how React can be used to make web applications more interactive and dynamic.
