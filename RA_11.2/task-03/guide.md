### Task Instructions

Your next task is to complete the `MovieCard` component by adding dynamic display for both row and seat information, enhancing the component's functionality with more detailed viewer-specific data.

1. **Display Row Information**: Find the `<span>` next to the "Row" label in the `MovieCard` component. Replace the placeholder with JSX to dynamically show the `row` prop.

2. **Display Seat Information**: Locate the `<span>` next to the "Seat" label within the `MovieCard`. Insert JSX to dynamically render the `seat` prop.

Ensure these changes accurately reflect in the UI for any given props to the `MovieCard` component.
