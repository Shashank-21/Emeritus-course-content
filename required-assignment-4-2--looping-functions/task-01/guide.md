In a grocery store, aisle labels are necessary for guiding customers. In this task, you'll use a `for` loop to display the aisle labels.

## Task Instructions:

**Total Points: 4**

Inside the `for` loop, your task is to create a string `label` that says `"Aisle {index}: {category}\n"`, where:
a. `index` is the aisle number (Which is the `index` variable inside the `for` loop)
b. `category` is a randomly generated category, which is also defined in the `for` loop.
c. `\n` is the new line character

To achieve this, follow these steps inside the `for` loop:
a. Add the value of the variable used for iteration (`index`) to the `label` variable using the `+=` operator. (`label += i`)
b. Add ": " to the `label` variable using the `+=` variable (`label += ": "`)
c. Add the value stored inside the `category` variable using the `+=` operator, as shown in the previous steps.
d. Finally, add the new line character (`"\n"`) to the `label` variable using the `+=` operator
