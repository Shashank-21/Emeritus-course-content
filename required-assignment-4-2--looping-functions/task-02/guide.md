Inside the `while` loop, store the information which includes the trip number and the number of items restocked for this trip in the format: "Trip X: Restocked Y items." inside the `tripInfo` variable. For this:

- Define a variable `tripInfo`. Assign the string `"Trip "` to the variable.
- Add the value of the `tripNumber` variable to the `tripInfo` variable using the `+=` operator (`tripInfo += trips;`).
- Add the string `": Restocked "` to the `tripInfo` variable using the `+=` operator.
- Add the value of the `itemsToRestock` variable to the `tripInfo` variable using the `+=` operator.
- Finally, add the string `"items."` to the `tripInfo` variable. Remember to add the period at the end.
