Inside the given `do-while` loop, check that the current code (`availableCodes[index]`) matches the entered code. If it's a match, set `resultString` to `"Coupon found!"` and `isFound` to `true`.

After the loop: Check that no coupon was found (use the `isFound` variable). If the value of `isFound` is `false`, set `resultString` to `"Coupon not found"`.

Refresh the webpage and enter a coupon code to test the code.
