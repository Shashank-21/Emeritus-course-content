The loop should continue as long as:\n- You have not reached the end of the `availableCodes` array, AND\n- The correct coupon code has yet to be found (`isFound` is false).\n\nInside the loop:\n1. Append a message to `compareString` that indicates which code to check.\n\t  - Format the message as: \"Checking against {current_code}...\\n\"\n2. Check that the current code (`availableCodes[index]`) matches the entered code.\n\t  - If it's a match, set `resultString` to `\"Coupon found!\"` and `isFound` to true.\n3. Increment the `index` to move to the next code in the next iteration.\n\nAfter the loop:\n4. Check that no coupon was found (use the `isFound` variable).\n\t  - If the value of `isFound` is false, set `resultString` to `\"Coupon not found\"`.\n",
