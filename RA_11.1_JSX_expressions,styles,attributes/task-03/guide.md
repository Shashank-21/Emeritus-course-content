### Task: Implement Interactive Color Switching in WelcomeCard Component

#### File to Edit

`WelcomeCard.js`

#### Task Description

In this task, you will add interactivity to the `WelcomeCard` component. Specifically, you'll make the "Switch color" button functional so that it toggles the background color of the paragraph when clicked.

#### Instructions

1. Locate the `<button>` tag within the `WelcomeCard` component.
2. Add the `onClick` attribute to this button.
3. Assign the `handleClick` function to the `onClick` attribute. This function (already defined in the component) changes the background color of the paragraph between 'yellow' and 'mintcream' each time the button is clicked.

#### Expected Outcome

- The "Switch color" button should be clickable.
- Each click on the button should toggle the background color of the paragraph between the two specified colors.
- Ensure that the color change is correctly reflected in the component's display.

#### Tips

- Remember to use the `onClick` event handler in React, which listens for click events on elements.
- Test the functionality by clicking the button and observing the changes in the paragraph's background color.
