**Task 1: Array Destructuring**

**Objective:** Practice array destructuring in ES6 by extracting the first two elements from a given array of colors and logging them to the console.

**Instructions:**

1. Your task is to fill in the missing code between the "Todo" comments.
2. Use array destructuring to assign the first element of the `colors` array to a variable named `primaryColor` and the second element to a variable named `secondaryColor`.
3. Once you have completed the task, uncomment the `console.log` statements to log the values of `primaryColor` and `secondaryColor`.

**Hints:**

- Remember the syntax for array destructuring: `const [element1, element2] = array;`
- Make sure to uncomment the `console.log` lines after completing the destructuring part.

**Expected Output:**
When you run your completed code, the output in the console should be:

```
Primary Color: red
Secondary Color: green
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Correct implementation of array destructuring.
- The correct assignment of values to `primaryColor` and `secondaryColor`.
- The code should log the correct primary and secondary colors as specified in the array.

Try it config: `node task-01/task-01.js`
