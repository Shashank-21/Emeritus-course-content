**Task 2: Object Destructuring**

**Objective:** Learn and practice object destructuring in ES6 by extracting the `name` and `profession` properties from a `person` object and using them to display a welcome message.

**Instructions:**

1. Destructure the `name` and `profession` properties from the `person` object provided in the starter code.
2. After completing the destructuring, uncomment the `console.log` line to use the destructured variables in the welcome message.
3. Make sure the final line for exporting the variables remains unchanged.
4. Run your code to check if it displays the correct welcome message.

**Hints:**

- Use the object destructuring syntax: `const { property1, property2 } = object;`
- Ensure that the `console.log` line is correctly uncommented after completing the destructuring.

**Expected Output:**
When you run your code after completing the task, the output in the console should be something like:

```
Welcome Alice, the Developer!
```
