### Introduction:

In this assignment, you will delve into the world of Single Page Applications (SPA) by implementing same-page routing using anchor tags and the `href` attribute. You'll be provided with a webpage that includes three sections: Home, About, and Contact. Your task is to enable smooth navigation between these sections without reloading the page, utilizing the power of internal linking within an HTML document.

### Instructions:

#### Task:

Your primary task is to add the correct `href` attributes to the anchor tags in the navigation bar. These links should allow users to jump to the corresponding sections on the page when clicked.

1. **Open the Starter Code**: In the `index.html` file, you will see a webpage with a navigation bar containing three anchor tags (`<a>`) without the `href` attribute set. Below the navbar, there are three sections: Home, About, and Contact.

2. **Add `href` Attributes**:

   - Locate the anchor tag with the ID `homeBtn` and add an `href` attribute so it links to the Home section (`#home`).
   - For the anchor tag with the ID `aboutBtn`, set the `href` attribute to link to the About section (`#about`).
   - For the anchor tag with the ID `contactBtn`, update the `href` attribute to link to the Contact section (`#contact`).

3. **Test Your Implementation**:

   - After adding the `href` attributes, click each link in the navigation bar. The browser should automatically scroll to the respective section of the page.
   - Ensure that clicking on "Home" takes you to the Home section, "About" to the About section, and "Contact" to the Contact section.
