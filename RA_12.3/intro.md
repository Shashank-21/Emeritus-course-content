### Assignment: Mounting and Unmounting in React

#### Introduction

This assignment focuses on the fundamental React concepts of mounting and unmounting components. You'll build an interactive application that dynamically adds and removes elements from the DOM, providing hands-on experience with React's component lifecycle.

#### Objective

Develop a simple yet interactive grid where users can add and remove squares. This project aims to deepen your understanding of how React components are created and destroyed, as well as how to manage state and handle events in response to user interactions.

#### Core Concepts

- **Component Lifecycle:** Gain practical experience with the phases of component mounting and unmounting.
- **State Management:** Learn to manage the application state as squares are added and removed from the grid.
- **Event Handling:** Handle user actions to dynamically update the component tree.

#### Tasks

1. **Implement the Grid Component:**

   - Create a grid that starts empty but can have squares added to it.
   - Each square should have a unique identifier visible to the user.

2. **Adding Squares:**

   - Allow users to add squares to the grid through a user action, such as clicking a button.

3. **Removing Squares:**
   - Implement functionality for users to remove a square from the grid. This could be through a button on each square.

#### Expected Outcome

- The grid updates in real time, accurately reflecting the current state as squares are added or removed.
- The application demonstrates clear understanding and implementation of React's mounting and unmounting processes.
