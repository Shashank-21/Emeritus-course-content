### Mounting the Square Component

### Task: Implement the `Square` Component in the Grid

**Objective:** Enhance the interactive color grid by replacing placeholder elements with the `Square` component to display dynamically added squares.

You'll be working on the `Grid.js` file in this task.

### Instructions:

1. **Identify the Placeholder:** Locate the placeholder `<div></div>` within the `map()` function inside the `Grid` component's return statement.

2. **Replace the Placeholder:**

   - Replace the placeholder `<div></div>` with the `Square` component.
   - Pass the appropriate props to each `Square` component:
     - `key`: The `key` prop is crucial when rendering lists of elements in React. It helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. This improves performance and ensures reliable behavior when updating the UI. Ensure each `Square` component has a unique `key` prop. In this case, `square.id` serves as a unique identifier for each square.
     - `squareNumber`: The number to be displayed in the center of the square. Use `square.id` for this value.
     - `color`: The background color of the square. Use `square.color` for this prop.

### Expected Outcome:

Upon completion, clicking the "+" sign will add new squares to the grid, each uniquely numbered and styled with the specified color. The importance of the `key` prop in list rendering will be demonstrated through this exercise, highlighting its role in React's rendering optimization and state management.
