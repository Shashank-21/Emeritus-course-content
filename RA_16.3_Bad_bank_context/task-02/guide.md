### Task Instructions

Your task is to enhance the `Deposit` component in React (In the file `deposit.js`), which should display the user's deposit information. You will utilize the `useContext` hook to access user data from the `UserContext` and render this information within the component.

1. **Utilize `useContext` Hook**: Import and utilize the `useContext` hook within the `Deposit` component to access the `UserContext`. Assign the context value to a variable for subsequent use. For guidance on how to use `useContext`, refer to the implementation in the `alldata.js` file.

2. **Display Deposit Information**: Modify the returned JSX to include the user's deposit information. After the "Deposit" text and a line break (`<br />`), render the stringified version of the context data. This will showcase the user's deposit and any additional user-related information contained within the context.

3. **Maintain Structure**: Ensure that the deposit information is displayed within an `h1` tag, following the "Deposit" text and a line break.

By following these instructions, you will successfully integrate user context into the `Deposit` component, allowing it to dynamically display user-specific deposit information.
