### Adding Context to the Bad Bank Application

In this assignment, you will be diving deeper into the world of React by enhancing the functionality of the Bad Bank application. The focus will be on integrating the React Context API to manage and distribute the application's state more effectively, particularly concerning user data.

The Context API is a powerful feature in React that enables you to share data across various components without the need to pass props down manually through each level of your component tree. This becomes increasingly beneficial as your application grows in complexity and size.

You will be tasked with implementing the Context API in the `Balance`, `Deposit`, `Login` and `Withdraw` components of the Bad Bank application. This will involve utilizing the UserContext to access user data across the application, thus demonstrating the power and efficiency of context in managing global application state.

Your work will not only improve the application's data handling but also give you hands-on experience with one of the more advanced and widely-used features in React development. This will be a step forward in your journey to mastering React and building more robust and maintainable web applications.

By the end of this assignment, you will have a deeper understanding of the Context API and how it can be used to streamline state management in React applications, making your development process more efficient and your applications more scalable and intuitive.
