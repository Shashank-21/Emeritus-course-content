### Spread Operator Task

#### Objective

Complete the `combineDishes` function to combine two arrays of dishes into one array using the JavaScript spread operator.

#### Task Requirements

1. **Understand the Starter Code:**

   - The `combineDishes` function currently takes two parameters, `dishes1` and `dishes2`, each expected to be an array of dish names.
   - The function initializes an empty array `dishes`.

2. **Complete the Function:**

   - Modify the `combineDishes` function to combine `dishes1` and `dishes2` into the `dishes` array.
   - Use the spread operator (`...`) to achieve this.
   - The spread operator should be used to expand both `dishes1` and `dishes2` inside the `dishes` array.

3. **Ensure Functionality:**

   - Your modified function should return a single array containing all elements from both `dishes1` and `dishes2`.
   - It should maintain the order of elements as they appear in the original arrays.

4. **Usage Example:**
   - If `dishes1` is `['Pasta', 'Burger']` and `dishes2` is `['Salad', 'Soup']`, the function should return `['Pasta', 'Burger', 'Salad', 'Soup']`.
