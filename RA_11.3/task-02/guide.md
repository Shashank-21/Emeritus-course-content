### Task Instructions

In this task, you'll be continuing to enhance the `MovieCard` component to include dynamic display of show time and screen information. Currently, the component accepts several props, including `title`, `showTime`, `screen`, and others, but the show time and screen are not yet displayed within the component.

1. **Display Show Time**: Inside the `MovieCard` component, locate the `<span>` element within the `div` that has a `<label>` of "Date & Time". Replace the placeholder with code that dynamically inserts the movie's show time passed as a prop.

2. **Display Screen Information**: Find the `<span>` element within the `div` that has a `<label>` for "Screen". Insert code to dynamically display the screen number or name provided via the `screen` prop.

Ensure your changes reflect dynamically in the UI when different props are passed to the `MovieCard` component.
