### Assignment Overview

This assignment involves building parts of a React application that interacts with the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch and display posts and their comments. You will complete the implementation of two components, `PostList` and `Post`.

### Task 1: Complete the PostList Component

#### Objectives:

- Fetch and display a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Implement a loading state to indicate data fetching.
- (Optional) Handle potential errors during the fetch operation gracefully.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. Modify the provided starter code for the `PostList` component to fetch posts from the given API endpoint.
2. Update the component's state with the fetched data and render the list of posts.
3. Ensure that a loading message is displayed while the data is being fetched.

### Task 2: Complete the Post Component

#### Objectives:

- For a given post, fetch and display its comments from the JSONPlaceholder API upon user interaction.
- Implement a loading state for when comments are being fetched.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. Modify the provided starter code for the `Post` component to fetch comments related to a post when the "Show Comments" button is clicked.
2. Update the component's state with the fetched comments and render them.
3. Display a loading message or indicator while comments are being fetched.

### General Guidelines

- Ensure your components handle and render the fetched data correctly, including loading and (optionally) error states.
- Make sure your code is well-commented and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
- Use modern JavaScript features and React best practices to implement the required functionalities.
