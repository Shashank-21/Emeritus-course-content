### Assignment Introduction: Routing Across Webpages using Buttons

In modern web development, creating a seamless user experience is crucial for engagement and usability. One aspect of this is the ability to navigate across different sections or pages of a website without the need for full-page reloads. This technique, often referred to as client-side routing, enhances the responsiveness and speed of a website, providing an app-like experience within a browser.

This assignment focuses on implementing client-side routing in a simple web application using JavaScript. You'll be tasked with creating a dynamic web page that loads different content based on user interaction without reloading the entire page. This is a fundamental concept in single-page applications (SPAs) where different "pages" or content are loaded asynchronously based on user actions, such as clicking buttons or links.

You'll use basic JavaScript, particularly the `fetch` API, to request and load content dynamically, and you'll manipulate the DOM to update the webpage content based on user interactions. This assignment will help you understand how client-side routing works and how you can use JavaScript to create interactive and responsive web applications.

By the end of this assignment, you will have a webpage that responds to user clicks on different buttons or links by loading new content into a designated area of the page without a full-page reload.

This assignment will not only improve your JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills but also give you a glimpse into how modern web frameworks and libraries handle routing and state management in more complex applications.
