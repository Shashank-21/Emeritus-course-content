### Task Instructions

**Objective**: Modify the event listener for the element with the id `"about"` to load content from the `"about.html"` file using the `loadContent` function when clicked.

1. You are provided with a function `loadContent(page)` that fetches content from a specified page and displays it inside the element with the id `"content"`.
2. There is an event listener attached to the element with the id `"about"`. Your task is to modify this event listener so that when the element is clicked, it calls the `loadContent` function with the argument `"about.html"`.
3. Ensure that the `loadContent` function is called with the correct argument when the element is clicked.
