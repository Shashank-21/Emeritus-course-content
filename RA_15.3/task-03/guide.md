### Task Instructions

**Objective:** Enhance the provided JavaScript code to enable dynamic content loading for an additional section of the webpage, ensuring content is updated without a page reload.

**Tasks:**

1. **Dynamic Content Loading for Contact Section:** You have a webpage with multiple sectionsâ€”About, Services, and Contact. The JavaScript function `loadContent` is used to fetch and display content dynamically for the About and Services sections. Your task is to implement this dynamic loading for the Contact section.

2. **Implement Click Event Listener:** Similar to how the "About" and "Services" sections are implemented, add functionality so that when the user clicks on the element with the ID `contact`, the `loadContent` function is called with `"contact.html"` as the argument.

**Expected Behavior:**

- When the user clicks on the "Contact" link (the element with the ID `contact`), the content from `contact.html` should be fetched and displayed within the element with the ID `content`, replacing any existing content.
